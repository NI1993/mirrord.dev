3. [install "Socks5 Configurator" chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/socks5-configurator/hnpgnjkeaobghpjjhaiemlahikgmnghb) 


#### Steps

1. In a terminal session, trigger `microsocks` using `mirrord`.
   1. Example: `mirrord exec -a production_ns -n production_ns -t deployment/my_deployment microsocks`
2. In a Chrome window:
   1. open the Socks5 Configurator extension
   2. make sure the "Socks5 Proxy" is enabled
   3. type in its respective textbox `127.0.0.1:1080`
   4. hit the save button
3. That's it! you can verify your ip address has changed via a quick "what is my ip address" search in google
