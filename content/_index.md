## The fastest/safest/easiet route to pre-production testing
By mirroring traffic to and from your machine, mirrord surrounds your local service with a mirror image of its cloud environment.

- Speed up your feedback loop - Test your service in the cloud from your local machine, without CI or deployment
- Lightweight - Get up and running in seconds Safe - Concurrently test on the same cloud environmen

<!-- ## Why deploy to staging when you can...
**not** deploy to staging?

By mirroring traffic to and from your machine, ***mirrord*** surrounds your local sergvice with a mirror image of its cloud environment.

### No more:
 - Mocking up databases/traffic/configuration
 - Waiting for the CI to run
 - Breaking the shared environment for everyone -->

<!-- ### Stop 🛑✋

- Mocking databases/traffic/configuration
- Waiting for the CI to run
- Breaking the shared environment for everyone

### Start ▶️
- Running your service locally, with remote service's context
- Receiving mirrored (duplicated) traffic in real time
- Having the same environment variables the remote service has
- Accessing resources available to the remote context such as databases, managed services, etc. -->
